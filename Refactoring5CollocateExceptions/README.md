# Refactorings

* now in `audit` package an exception is added `AuditException` which is thrown in `AuditFacade` and has to be handled by callers
* in `build.xml`: no changes

# Dependencys

nothing much has changed here

here we see the new exception `AuditException` which gets referenced quite a lot from `bill` and `ui`

# Artefact

`billpay.war`: no changes

`bill.jar` only contains `bill`, no changes

`auditspec.jar` which (only) contains `audit` package, now contains the new `AuditException`
